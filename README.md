# Semantic Segmentation of Aerial Imagery üåç

This project focuses on pixel-wise classification of aerial/satellite imagery using deep learning models like U-Net and ResNet-based UNet. The goal is to extract meaningful land features such as buildings, roads, water, and vegetation for urban planning, agriculture, and environmental analysis.

## üöÄ Project Overview

- Segment satellite images into 6 categories: Buildings, Land, Roads, Vegetation, Water, and Unlabeled areas.
- Trained using both custom and pretrained deep learning models (U-Net, ResNet34-UNet).
- Web demo built with Flask for interactive predictions.

## üìä Dataset

Dataset from [Humans in the Loop (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/humansintheloop/semantic-segmentation-of-aerial-imagery) containing high-resolution satellite imagery of Dubai, annotated with semantic classes.

## üõ† Tools & Technologies

- Python, Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV
- Flask (for deployment)
- Patchify, Albumentations (for data preparation & augmentation)
- Matplotlib, NumPy, PIL, Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, GitHub

## ‚ú® Features

- üîç Preprocessing: Patchify aerial tiles to 256√ó256 segments.
- üß† Training: Uses Dice + Focal loss with class weighting.
- üìà Evaluation: Mean IoU, Dice Coefficient, Accuracy.
- üñº Visualization: Overlay masks & confidence maps.
- üåê Web App: Upload aerial images and get segmented masks instantly.

## üåü Advantages

- High precision in detecting complex land patterns.
- Easily extendable to new datasets or custom label schemes.
- Lightweight web interface for real-time predictions.
- Integrates both standard and pretrained segmentation pipelines.
